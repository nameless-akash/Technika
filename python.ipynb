Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.14.2/numpy/lib/twodim_base.py#L140-L194)."
